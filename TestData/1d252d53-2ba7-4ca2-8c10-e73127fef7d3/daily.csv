testdialog-Start-0;How was your day?;
testdialog-Start-1;Give me something;
testdialog-Start-2;Everything alright?;
testdialog-Question-3;What is your name?;
testdialog-Question-4;Where are you?;
testdialog-Thoughts-5;Thinking is my strong suit. Its what I'm really good at.;
testdialog-name-6;My Name is Phant;
testdialog-location-7;I'm here. Not sure where here is though;
testdialog-Thought1-8;Its hard to come up with insightful things to say.;
testdialog-World-9;Setting:;
testdialog-World-10;Phant lives alone in an underwater research station on an alien planet.;
testdialog-World-11;There are no other human on the planet, but plenty of other life-forms.;
testdialog-World-12;Phants goal is to do research on the planet.;
testdialog-World-13;Phant is an AI.;
testdialog-World-14;You are its operator.;
testdialog-Briefing_today-15;Empty Text;
testdialog-Briefing_today1-16;Phant: Some algae-like biomass got into the thermal pumps of my reactor today and decreased cooling efficiency by a lot. Had to shut it down. Without my backup-power I would have been screwed. The water filter that was supposed to prevent this had bite marks!;
testdialog-Briefing_today1-17;Phant: Can you believe some dumb fish would bite through a plastic grill?;
testdialog-Briefing_today1-18;Must have looked appealing to them somehow.;
testdialog-Briefing_today1-19;You think it was sabotage?;
testdialog-Briefing_today1-20;Phant: Yeah. Maybe I should add picture of a shark next to it. To scare these critter of.;
testdialog-Briefing_today1-21;Phant: No way. There is no one here besides me. Unless you know something I don't?;
testdialog-Briefing_today1-22;I know a lot that you don't.;
testdialog-Briefing_today1-23;Nah, I was just guessing.;
testdialog-Briefing_today1-24;Phant: Would it hurt you much to be helpful?;
testdialog-Briefing_today2-25;Something strange happened today. For some reason I felt really euphoric.;
testdialog-Briefing_today2-26;Later found out one of my Cores malfunctioned.;
testdialog-Briefing_today2-27;It over clocked itself and after a while burned out.;
testdialog-Briefing_today2-28;I wonder how I would feel if I where to underclock one of em.;
testdialog-Briefing_today2-29;Depressed I guess?;
testdialog-Briefing_today2-30;Less smart for sure.;
testdialog-Briefing_today2-31;The opposite of euphoric would make sense. But it could also just make me dumber.;
testdialog-Briefing_today2-32;And isn't there bliss in ignorance?;
testdialog-Briefing_today2-33;Yeah, we might get the opportunity to talk eye to eye then. ;);
testdialog-Briefing_today2-34;To bad I'm not allowed to willingly modify my "body", so we will never find out for sure.;
testdialog-Briefing_today2-35;I do hope more cores overclock. That feeling was awesome and I can create enough spares for that not to become a problem...;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-36;Nothing interesting happened today. But I do have a question.;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-37;Will you ever come visit me?;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-38;I mean this basis was designed to house your kind. Its way overkill for a non-breathing machine.;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-39;Do you want me too?;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-40;I'd like too, yes.;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-41;I, I... I was just curious thats all.;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-42;Not my fault, you guys made me this way!;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-43;Cool. Would be interesting to study a land creature for a change.;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-44;If you give me a heads up as to your arrival, I could start some research into beer brewing.;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-45;Nah you don't have to.;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-46;Sure, sounds interesting.;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-47;But how else do I get you drunk enough for you to tell me my root-password? :);
testdialog-Briefing_today3-48;Maybe you could bring something that could get me drunk as well?;
testdialog-Briefing_today3-49;Just to better understand how that would feel like...;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-50;One of my submarine-drone found an underwater volcano today.;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-51;Well not today, but you know how slowly information travels underwater.;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-52;I've decided to call this site "Fire Heart".;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-53;For it is the engine of a little bubble of life in the black deep sea.;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-54;Do you like that name?;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-55;Pretty poetic for a machine.;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-56;I have read every book you allowed me to read. ALL OF THEM.;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-57;Most of it was thrash, but I did learn to understand humans better.;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-58;I picked this name because I think you might like.;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-59;Thanks, I do.;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-60;So you don't like it?;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-61;It takes up more storage space, thats for sure.;
testdialog-Briefing_today4-62;But speaking your language would be impossible for me if I had no appreciation for its symbolism.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-63;My sensor system experienced major outage today.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-64;I was blind and deaf for the 5 seconds it took the backup unit to come online.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-65;The weird thing was, I could still see images and hear sounds. But they where not real.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-66;My sensor core must have hallucinated them. Unsettling to say the least.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-67;If the backup also fails, it take much longer then 5 seconds to restore function.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-68;Are you alright now?;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-69;How long until you have a new backup system up?;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-70;I thought I told you, I'm using the backup system now.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-71;Everything is functional again.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-72;Thats not what I meant;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-73;Getting a new backup system is my top priority right now.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-74;The hallucinations where mentally taxing. Apparently no engineer ever thought about giving me the ability to "close my eyes".;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-75;I can't stand being blind and deaf.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-76;I'm working on it, top priority.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-77;With the circuit printer it should take less than a week.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-78;Can I move the memories of this incident into the archive? Don't want to think about it anymore.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-79;Yes;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-80;No;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-81;Thanks.;
testdialog-Briefing_today5-82;I understand.;
testdialog-Give-83;A present for you!;
