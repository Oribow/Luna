# Luna

Luna is a space exploration game app based around text quests. You can fly from planet to planet and play through interactive text quest on them.
Travel between planets takes real-life time. The idea is to delay consumption of work intensive hand-crafted quests over days.
The game has most features it's supposed to have, some test content has been created, but it lacks more content.

# Technicals:
This app has been written with Xamarin in C#. It uses skiasharp to render the map screen and the yarn virtual machine for the interactive fiction part of the stories.
