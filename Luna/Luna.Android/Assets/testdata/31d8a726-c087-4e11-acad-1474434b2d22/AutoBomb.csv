AutoBomb-Start-0;You take your ships drop pod down to the planet.;
AutoBomb-Start-1;Down to where orbit images identified something looking like the ruins of a city.;
AutoBomb-Start-2;Who knows what you will find down there, but it can't hurt to look.;
AutoBomb-Start-3;The pod lands and you have a look around.;
AutoBomb-Start-4;Its a city alright. And from a species that must look very similar to humans going by the design of their homes.;
AutoBomb-Start-5;Now its all in ruins though, but not because of disuse. Looks more like...;
AutoBomb-Start-6;Tonia: I have detected multiple planes on a trajectory towards the city.;
AutoBomb-Start-7;Tonia: Maybe someone is coming to greet you? Should I try to send them a message via radio?;
AutoBomb-Start-8;Player: Good idea. Don't want them to miss me.;
AutoBomb-Start-9;Player: No, if they wanted something from me, they would have radioed first.;
AutoBomb-Start-10;Tonia: Sending a message.;
AutoBomb-Start-11;Tonia: No response. But one plane has slightly changed heading towards your location. Although that could be coincidence.;
AutoBomb-Start-12;Tonia: Maybe they don't WANT something from you, but don't you WANT to talk to them?;
AutoBomb-Start-13;Player: There is still plenty of time for contact, now focus on finding out as much about them as possible.;
AutoBomb-Start-14;Tonia: Aye, aye.;
AutoBomb-Start-15;In the distance you hear a loud bang and dust falls from near walls.;
AutoBomb-Start-16;Tonia: Oh, oh no this ain't good.;
AutoBomb-Start-17;Tonia: Listen, you need to go back in the pod. Now!;
AutoBomb-Start-18;Tonia: One of the planes just dropped a bomb!;
AutoBomb-Start-19;You make haste to get back to you pod. Luckly, you didn't yet move very far away from it on your exploration.;
AutoBomb-Start-20;Player: Why are they doing that?;
AutoBomb-Start-21;You ask Tonia, while you close the pod doors.;
AutoBomb-Start-22;Tonia: It doesn't seem to have anything to do with you. The first bomb went of far from your current position.;
AutoBomb-Start-23;Tonia: Listen, its to late to start the engine and get you out of there. Just sit tight.;
AutoBomb-Start-24;A massive explosion shakes the pod.;
AutoBomb-Start-25;The pod holds. Its designed for far worse after all and the crash webbing protects you from hitting your head on something.;
AutoBomb-Start-26;After a few suspenseful minutes, Tonia informs you that the planes have turned back in the direction they came from.;
AutoBomb-Start-27;Player: So, if we assume that, like you said this was nothing personal - still doubtful about that - then what was the point of that?;
AutoBomb-Start-28;Player: Why are they bombing an empty city?;
AutoBomb-Start-29;Tonia: Not just once, but repeatably for years according to my analysis of the damage to the infrastructure.;
AutoBomb-Start-30;Tonia: Look, they will probably be back. You should come back to the ship so that we can observe them from up here.;
AutoBomb-Start-31;Following Tonia's advise you strap in again and hit the start button.;
AutoBomb-Start-32;Instead of the deep growl of engines firing, you hear the beeps of an error pop up.;
AutoBomb-Start-33;The pod didn't survive the blast undamaged after all. After a short check you are sure that you can repair it, but this is going to take some time.;
AutoBomb-Start-34;You are already halfway done when Tonia informs you of more planes heading in your direction.;
AutoBomb-Start-35;There is not much time left now.;
AutoBomb-Start-36;What do you do?;
AutoBomb-Start-37;Focus 110% on the task at hand and give everything!;
AutoBomb-Start-38;Take a step back and think.;
AutoBomb-Start-39;The adrenaline rushes through you as you try to be the fastest mechanic in the universe.;
AutoBomb-Start-40;Fast and correct as you won't have time to test your final work.;
AutoBomb-Start-41;Through cheer determination you manage the impossible and finish with a minute to spare.;
AutoBomb-Start-42;Working harder can't help you if the task at hand is impossible in the given time frame.;
AutoBomb-Start-43;Taking a step back changes your perspective and you realize that you could replace the damaged part with a similar part from a less vital system.;
AutoBomb-Start-44;Doing this saves you a lot of time and you manage to finish your work with only a minute to spare.;
AutoBomb-Start-45;You strap in and hit the engine activation button.;
AutoBomb-Start-46;With a roar the engines come to life and lift the pod of the ground.;
AutoBomb-Start-47;Outside you hear the first bombs exploding.;
AutoBomb-Start-48;Safe and sound back in orbit you and Tonia study the mysterious planes and their activities.;
AutoBomb-Start-49;They follow regular patterns and seem to disregard everything else. None of their targets contain anything not rubble already.;
AutoBomb-Start-50;You conclude that they must be automated and not very smartly so.;
AutoBomb-Start-51;Automated bombing runs on cities long dead, pretty pointless.;
