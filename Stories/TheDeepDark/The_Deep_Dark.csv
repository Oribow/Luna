line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Start-0;As you continue your journey you unexpectedly come across something... odd to say the least.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Start-1;And by odd you mean terrifying and inexplicable as what you've come across seems to be nothing at all. More specifically, a hole in space that definitely should not be there. You stare at the emptiness of it displayed on screen and wonder what it could be.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Start-2;You've never seen anything like it. The closest thing you've ever heard of is stories you'd been told about the early days of space exploration. Back before black holes could be detected or harnessed for space travel. Holes in sensory data that make it seem like they were consuming space-time itself. Which, funnily enough, is what the years of research more or less proved was happening. In a way.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Start-3;But this was different. The reality of the old stories was simply that the technology at the time was incapable of registering light paths in a quantum state. That breakthrough had led to the observation of the light passing into a collapsing singularity, unlocking faster then light travel. Here there was no light. Not even in a quantum state. As if it were impossible for light to exist there.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Start-4;On the one hand this is a unique theoretical impossibility that you'll likely never have another opportunity to explore. On the other it's likely that something that reality breaking will be... dangerous to say the least.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Start-5;What do you want to do?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Start-6;Not all mysteries are meant to be solved.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Start-7;There's no telling what you'll find and you find that prospect irresistible.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Pass-8;As intriguing as this is you decide that sometimes your curiosity maybe shouldn't be sated. You continue on your course, watching the negative space of this mysterious hole until you travel far enough that it no longer registers on your sensors.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Check_it_out-9;Why explore space at all if you're going to ignore its most intriguing mysteries? It's impossible to lock onto the hole itself but you figure you can plot a exit point close enough. As you do warnings blare across your console.;

line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Check_it_out-14;Maybe not. You continue on your journey. You wonder what else you'll find.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Confirm_Jump-15;You punch in coordinates close to this "hole", but not too close. It may be undetectable, but anything that big is going to have enough mass to be wary of.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Confirm_Jump-16;You sit back as the familiar pulse of the warp drive activates and space folds and reveals infinity. Your ship dips in and you are [i]pulled[/i] as if from all directions as tendrils of color fling themselves around you.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Confirm_Jump-17;And then you're there.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Confirm_Jump-18;You've never experienced such a substantive darkness. It feels as if you can just reach out and grasp it, pulling some away like snowball, if snow were an inpenetrable void. It reminds you of that place in the ocean where it drops suddenly, forming a great big blue fathomless hole in the sea.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Confirm_Jump-19;You had hoped that proximity to the anomaly would reveal something about it but to both your eyes and all your ship's sensors there's just... [i]nothing[/i].;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Confirm_Jump-20;It's quite the conundrum. No known phenomena should come close to accomplishing anything like this. At least nothing proven.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Confirm_Jump-21;You're reminded of an old theory referring to so called "Dark Matter". Before advanced space travel scientists were baffled at observed behaviors of the universe that didn't quite make sense. They believed that it suggested the presence of some form of unobservable matter which was [i]almost[/i] correct. The effects they observed with primitive precision were in fact being caused by matter they could not detect. What they hadn't considered was that this was because the matter in question was in another universe. They couldn't see it because it was affecting them from the outside.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Confirm_Jump-22;You wonder what they would think if they saw this. Now, what will you do?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Confirm_Jump-23;Send in a probe.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Confirm_Jump-24;Move closer and try to calibrate sensors.;

line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Move_Closer-27;While unnerving to look at the... whatever it is seems harmless enough. The sensors may not be working but you don't feel that familiar pull you've experienced when on the cusp of a great mass' event horizon.;

line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Force_Field_Containment-94;It's time to get creative. You're not sure if you've ever done something like this before but when has that ever stopped you from trying? You slowly position the ship closer to the dark cloud, calibrating the force field around you to emit a smaller version of itself like a bubble or a bud attached to its side. It seems to hold steady as you inch painfully towards the void, fighting all the while your fear that you will fall inside and never stop falling.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Force_Field_Containment-95;The smaller field appears to make contact with the substance although it's hard to tell without readings.

You watch in dismay as it stretches out towards you, the protection it usually forms twisted into a grotesque weapon of inertial forces.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Force_Field_Containment-96;It touches the ship so gently that it's a shock to watch as the metal distorts, bending like tin under its warping effects.

line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Reconfigure_Probe-97;It may not be much but it might be enough to act as a guide for a probe. You adjust the probe's sensors to prioritize for the temperature variation and send it along its way.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Reconfigure_Probe-98;It seems to go much the same as before. The probe enters the dark and is soon swallowed up by it.

line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Directed_Light-103;Now that you've got a direction maybe you can glean something from using the light beam. You input the trajectory and watch as the light field focuses itself down into a beam that cuts across the black like a knife.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Directed_Light-104;The cut is wide but shallow, revealing nothing but the shallow skin of it. Your sensors tell you that the light seems to continue through, though there's no telling how far.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Directed_Light-105;In any case the light is either missing the object inside or it's just not penetrating deep enough.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Directed_Light-106;What would you like to do?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Directed_Light-107;It might help to know what exactly this stuff is.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Directed_Light-108;You need more data. Send in more probes.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiple_Probes-109;You've got a vague direction but finding things in space often requires more. You decide to release multiple probes at different points in order to get a more accurate fix on the object's position. They spread out in front of you, approaching the void in delicate arcs, their wakes producing trails like glowing threads loosely woven together.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiple_Probes-110;As before they all disappear quickly within its depths, but it's enough to show a trend in their trajectories. Initial calculations show a definite nexus between the points but it will take time to account for the friction inherent in the abyss. And that's assuming that there isn't anything else affecting the flight paths of the probes. With so little data to go on, anything seems possible.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiple_Probes-111;How would you like to proceed?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiple_Probes-112;You're tired of waiting. Head inside to check out what this is.;

line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiple_Probes-115;[[Directed Light]];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Go-116;It seems pretty direct.

You see no reason to waste any more time and decide to plot your course and head inside.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Go-117;You go cautiously forward, ready to jump the instant you feel the oh too familiar pull of an event horizon. It all seems to go well, although you can't help but think that the void growing as you near it feels like a great mouth about to swallow you.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Go-118;Still you feel nothing out of the ordinary until the field protecting your ship comes into contact with the dark. It shimmers and sizzles, crackling with a rainbow of light spreads and shatters the field, its shards slicing into you and everything around you.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Go-119;You feel a sensation as if falling into impossible depths while all around you colors you've never dreamed of ripple and then snuff out in an instant.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Wait-120;You decide it will be worth it for you to wait until the calculations are finished and verified. This might take a while.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Wait-121;[Wait One Hour];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Wait-122;Finally the computer completes the calculations, though of course with a very big disclaimer that the results are based on limited data and should be considered unreliable.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Wait-123;The results are odd but not entirely unexpected. The final trajectories actually proved to be a little off from each other. They don't actually quite meet together but are offset just enough to suggest that the object they are tracking may be orbiting around something. This suggests two alarming facts.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Wait-124;First, the object seems to be affected by something that doesn't at all register on your instruments. How that's possible is anyone's guess.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Wait-125;And second. The object is distant enough that its orbit could be confused for its location.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Wait-126;These two factors along with the fact that it's mired in an impenetrable cloak of black means that navigating to it will be difficult at best, if not impossible.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Wait-127;Do you still wish to try?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Wait-128;You have a more precise target than ever. If anything were to happen by hitting it with a light beam it's now.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Wait-129;You don't know enough about this darkness to make any sort of decision. Try for a sample.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Wait-130;[[Go]];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Accurate_Light-131;Now you have a more or less precise location to direct your light. You pick a point in the object's "orbit" and program the spectral field to condense into a single, white hot beam.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Accurate_Light-132;It pierces into the darkness but is quickly overtaken by it. You maintain the beam, unsure of what you expect to happen but confident somehow that something will.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Accurate_Light-133;You're still shocked when it does. It's faint but sensors pick up a tiny flickering of light, like a spark about to sputter out.

line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Impossible-325;[i]It has been a long time since I've been reminded of that.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Impossible-326;You're starting to sound human;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Impossible-327;What was the nature of the Operators?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Human-328;A figure appears amid the ripples. You think it's supposed to be you but the image shifts constantly, as if you were watching whatever this thing's imagination was coming up when thinking of you.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Human-329;[i]Am I? I hadn't quite noticed. This is all very new to me. I believe your... point as you call it may have 'broken the ice' so to speak between us.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Human-330;[i]Funny things these words. They mean so much more than they seem.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Human-331;Who are you?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Human-332;What is this place?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Nexus-333;[i]A Nexus.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Nexus-334;The figure leaves the statement like that as if it answers everything but then gets visibly annoyed when it senses you do not understand. Funny how quickly it picks up some things but not others.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Nexus-335;[i]Ah, I see. Your species is abnormally unaware of the nature of the multiverse. No wonder you have to use words to understand one another.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Nexus-336;[i]This place is a Nexus. A point in which the fabrics of multiple realities fold upon themselves into a multi-spacial singularity. This facility was built to take advantage of this phenomena in order to peer into alternate universes.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Nexus-337;[[Who]];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Nexus-338;How does it work?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Who-339;[i]I may sound human to you right now but I'm not sure I qualify as a 'who' in your book. In any case I think words lack the ability to adequately convey the answer to that question even under normal circumstances.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Who-340;[i]In your terms I am somewhat a caretaker. I once helped to construct this place. But that was before I gave up my form and bound myself here.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Who-341;Are you a prisoner?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Who-342;[[Nexus]];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Prisoner-343;[i]A prisoner? No. In this place I have the time and freedom to see the whole splendor of creation unfold right in front of me. Part of my binding is that I never desire to leave. Surprises like yourself make it worthwhile.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Prisoner-344;[[Nexus]];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Magic-345;[i]The facility has quantum apertures that when adjusted allow an observer to limit the spectrum in which they are observing the multiverse.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Magic-346;Can you see this for yourself?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Magic-347;You believe you've had enough of this strange, oddly condescending being;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Try-348;[i]The multiverse is a very big place for a little organic paradox[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Try-349;[i]Even at a very limited aperture I'm not sure your mind could take the strain of the information.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Try-350;How are you a paradox exactly?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Try-351;You believe you've had enough of this strange, oddly condescending being;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Try-352;You haven't come all this way not to at least try;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Paradox-353;[i]Organic life has existed in endless multitudes across the multiverse forever. Organic material simply comes together at some point and forms the basis of what you call life.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Paradox-354;[i]Though I've never seen anything develop like the brain you have. I think that's what makes you different.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Paradox-355;Maybe that's what will let you see into the multiverse;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Paradox-356;You believe you've had enough of this strange, oddly condescending being;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Try_Anyway-357;[i]Very well. I admit I am curious to see the multiverse through your lens. I will go as slowly as I am able. I cannot know how much will be too much for you to handle. Are you sure you wish to do this?[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Try_Anyway-358;You believe you've had enough of this strange, oddly condescending being;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Try_Anyway-359;You understand the risk. Do it.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Leave-360;You ask the being if you can leave.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Leave-361;[i]Of course. I never meant to keep you here against your will. I was merely curious. You are the most unique thing I have encountered in a very long time. I hope this meeting was as memorable for you as it was for me.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Leave-362;[i]I've uploaded a flight path that will see you safely outside of the Nexus. Make sure you don't use your jump drives until then.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Leave-363;You feel the insistent hugging of the conduit all around you relax and find you can stand. You approach the door with apprehension but as promised it opens for you, leading you back to your ship.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Leave-364;You take a moment to look back at the open door. You cannot know what you are leaving behind. But maybe it is better this way.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Leave-365;You board your ship and just as you sit the layers of metal unfurl once more and you are eased out once more into the dark. As promised the flight path lights up on your monitor. How it could track anything in this you can't possibly know. You can only be grateful it gave you this way out since you had no idea how you would escape in the first place.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Leave-366;It will take hours for your ship to escape the abyss. You might as well get some rest. You program the autopilot to follow your flight path and jump upon reaching your destination and then close your eyes. It's not long before you are asleep.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiverse-367;[i]I'm not sure you do...[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiverse-368;The figure looks sad before it dissolves, returning back into maelstrom of light all around you.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiverse-369;It's slow at first, slow and insidious as transitioning from awake to asleep. As if watching the formation of a dream you see the ripples start to converge into shapes. Vague at first but getting clearer.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiverse-370;There are stars. So many stars. Stars superimposed by stars so many times they fill the void of space so that there is no black but one vast sheet of rippling light, full to the brim with color, And yet, impossibly, between this saturated sea of suns is stuffed an obscene myriad of planets.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiverse-371;It all writhes like a vast, shapeless heart until it cuts off suddenly. You're left short of breath.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiverse-372;[i]You see? Even I did not know your perception was so limited.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiverse-373;Was that the multiverse?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiverse-374;You still want to try. Maybe start with just one universe?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Multiverse-375;You believe you've had enough of this strange, oddly condescending being;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Perception-376;[i]No. That was as much of the multiverse that you could comprehend before your brain started to overload.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Perception-377;Try it this time but go for smaller. One universe at a time.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Perception-378;You believe you've had enough of this strange, oddly condescending being;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Keep_Going-379;[i]That is more limiting than I thought possible... But it just might work.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Keep_Going-380;The figure dissolves once more from the display, the ripples dancing chaotically all around you. This time though, you notice that they start to fall into a sort of pattern. A rhythm that swishes like the skirts of a flamenco dancer as she spins. You feel yourself being eased into... somewhere...;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Keep_Going-381;And like falling into a dream you're there.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Keep_Going-382;The size of any universe is daunting. There is more space than can be conceived of, let alone explored. And yet here you are seeing it all. Trillions of burning suns and molten planets. Frozen comets and fire and void and the silent screaming of the expanding, imploding, colliding, dispersing galaxies.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Keep_Going-383;You can see it splitting, tearing, forming again like cells dividing and combining to form the building blocks of life. You hear the murmur of ten billion worlds. Life thrumming as it spreads across the planets and reaches out towards space. It all comes together in a discordant susurrus that plays upon your spine.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Keep_Going-384;You try to focus on the details but as you do your awareness seems to split like endless prisms so that you become only aware of the whole of whatever you want to focus on. Instead of seeing your home planet you see all planets displayed in countless windows in your mind. Instead of your people you see all the peoples populating all the corners of the universe. Every attempt to adjust, to limit the information makes it worse, your thoughts compiling till you are helpless to them, each addition sending a shock to your brain.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Keep_Going-385;[i]Enough.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Keep_Going-386;It cuts you off, appearing like a reprimanding father to you.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Keep_Going-387;[i]I keep telling you that this is too much for you.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Keep_Going-388;You can't explain why, but you're pretty sure the being showed you your own universe. You'd like to see an alternate one.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Keep_Going-389;You believe you've had enough of this strange, oddly condescending being;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Alternate-390;[i]I gave you the easy one and it still almost overwhelmed you. You think you're ready to see other, more unexpected possibilities?[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Alternate-391;You've explored all sorts of places in this universe. How can you not try and peek into another?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Alternate-392;You believe you've had enough of this strange, oddly condescending being;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Explore-393;The being is far less polite this time and quickly thrusts you into the stormy chaos of an unfamiliar universe.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Explore-394;This one has an abundance of plasma. Instead of igniting and exploding, apparently this universe began as a deluge of plasma. You see rivers of it spanning lightyears, a network of glowing strings of light.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Explore-395;And what was in those things. Creatures large and with one great eye so huge that it looks like a mouth. The creature seems to girded by what you could only describe as a mechanical ant-hill. Insect like machines cover it from head to toe, seeming to mine something from its skin. From all appearances it doesn't seem to mind.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Explore-396;There are creatures beyond count swimming freely in these rivers. Some of the greater beasts guide the flows, causing them to damn up and swirl into lakes and vast oceans.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Explore-397;You're struck by this universe's disparate beauty and with this opening up on your mind to the possibilities of the multiverse you feel as if a gentle push with your mind will open up its secrets to you.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Explore-398;Do you think you're ready?;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Explore-399;Ready or not you have to see this.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Explore-400;You're definitely not ready.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Push-401;You've come this far. Without entirely knowing how you manage to 'push' against the aperture of this universe and extend it beyond. The same overwhelming picture of the endless stars emerges once more and yet somehow this time you can see even more.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Push-402;They don't just hand motionless in the ether. Rather they flit like sparks shooting off a fire. Spinning like leaves in the wind during an inferno. You can feel the whole multiverse flood into you, the roiling of existence pervading the entirety of your body, lifting you up while crushing you into oblivion.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Push-403;It's more than a thousand minds could hold and it's all flooding mercilessly into you. There is no stopping it. At last your mind breaks and is left vulnerable to the onslaught of the multiverse. Wave upon wave of conflicting realities that leave you lost in a spiral of agony and ecstasy.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-Push-404;You will never leave.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-No-405;[i]A wise decision. I believe you were at the limits of your perception. Anything further would have been too much for you.[/i];
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-No-406;You suddenly feel an urge to prove this thing wrong.;
line:.\TheDeepDark\The_Deep_Dark.yarn-No-407;You believe you've had enough of this strange, oddly condescending being;
