The panels around you turn to static then fade to darkness while the hum of the engine dies, replaced by a loud hiss as the emergency thrusters slow you down.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Activate_emergency_shutoff-144;Soon you're drifting comfortably in space. It's a relief to no longer be pasted to your seat but that fades as you stare into the vast emptiness all around you.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Activate_emergency_shutoff-145;For now you are safe but exhausted. You'll need to rest before you can tackle this new problem.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Wait_for_safety_limits-146;You decide to give the ship a little more time to recover. You have no idea where you are and don't like the prospect of being stranded here.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Wait_for_safety_limits-147;Moments pass and still nothing from the safety limits. What do you do?;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Wait_for_safety_limits-148;Just a little longer...;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Wait_for_safety_limits-149;Activate the emergency shutoff.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Wait_just_a_little_longer-150;You still wait, hoping against hope. Maybe it's your brain turning liquid but you can't help but laugh and blackness starts to encroach upon your vision till with a single sharp, searing pain you stop seeing anything at all.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Activate_the_emergency_shutoff_2-151;You've given the ship long enough. You go to activate the emergency shutoff but find yourself light-headed and dizzy. Try as you might you don't quite have the strength to pull it back. You sit still, practically crushed in your seat as you feel a sharp pop inside your skull and a red tinged blackness overcomes your vision.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Engage_now_5-152;You activate the thrusters but as you do so the ship pitches wildly sending it into a nauseating spin. You try to regain control but you're hardly able to tell up from down.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Engage_now_5-153;As you look out you see that somehow you've managed to shoot yourself across the star in a trajectory that is perfectly tangent with its surface. For some reason the angle of approach allows your ship to escape the worst of the star's ravages as it descends to the surface.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Engage_now_5-154;Instead of being immediately consumed your ship somehow glances off its surface, skipping like a stone across a pond.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Engage_now_5-155;This repeats twice, sending up crashing waves of fire and lightning till at last the miracle ends and your ship succumbs to the heat and pressures of the star. They attack you so viciously that you are gone before you can feel it.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Hold_off_3-156;It's still not the right time. Too late you realize that it never will be quite perfectly right and that perhaps you have lost your opportunity. Before you can consider engaging the thrusters your ship starts to spin wildly, plunging itself straight into the core of the star, obliterated in an instant.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Dont_jump-157;You hesitate. There's too many variables. Too many unknowns. Even if you don't jump instantly to your death you could easily end up stranded somewhere worse. Is it really worth the risk?;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Dont_jump-158;Your hesitation takes its toll. Without acting to move the ship the star now has its full grip on your ship and is pulling you towards it at alarming speed. You try to engage forward thrusters, dampeners, anything but all the conflicting forces makes it all useless to initialize. Jumping may be your only option... if it works.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Dont_jump-159;Jump!;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Dont_jump-160;Wait for systems to respond.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Confirm_Jump-161;You don't hesitate to activate the hyperdrive. You feel it power up, the distortions it 	creates in the universe as it prepares to tear a hole and force you through it. Finally everything 	shifts and you are plunged into a space beyond space. A realm so full of light and color that you 	can only remember it as a blank canvas of white, even though for a moment you see all of its 	vivid, impossible beauty.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Confirm_Jump_2-162;You decide to take your chances. It's not like you could end up in a much worse place at the moment. As you activate the jump engines you notice an odd sort of blue electrical aura surround the ship. You'd always noticed things becoming off while powering up the hyperdrive, things becoming askew, distances stretching out. But you've never seen something like this happen before. You think about aborting but before you move to do so the jump activates prematurely. The blue electric current all around you consuming both you and the ship.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Confirm_Jump_2-163;It could have been a moment or ten thousand years but later you materialize on a planet that looks like the skin of some great dragon. Sharp metal scales cover the entire surface. They shiver in place.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Confirm_Jump_2-164;Above hangs the magnetar. Something about the atmosphere of this planet makes it look  a much deeper blue here than in space. It almost seems as if it were covered in one great ocean.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Confirm_Jump_2-165;You don't know how, but you managed to jump to a planet within the neutron star's system. You wonder what the chances of that are and decide it must not have been random. Perhaps that blue lightning had something to do with it.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Confirm_Jump_2-166;In any case your ship seems to have power but almost no systems outside of life support are functional. You should probably run a diagnostic.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Confirm_Jump_2-167;Quick Diagnostic. More general scan. Finds faults within systems but recommends more involved fixes to avoid complications.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Confirm_Jump_2-168;Precise Diagnostic: More thorough diagnostic. Takes longer but often finds the 			specific problem and offers easier solutions.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Wait_for_system_response-169;You still don't want to risk it. Pretty soon the magnetic fields become so strong they interfere with your systems. Lights flicker in and out ominously until they die for good. Now you can't jump even if you wanted to.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Wait_for_system_response-170;The spinning and all the forces working on you quickly make you lose consciousness. A mercy as your ship becomes engulfed in the terrible fury of the neutron star.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Try_changing_course-171;You feel as heavy as ten thousand suns but you have to steer further out. You try to lift your hand but it doesn't budge. It takes all of your strength and focus just to lift it from your arm rest. Slowly, achingly slowly, you inch towards the steering panel. It feels as if your arm will snap in two from the effort.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Try_changing_course-172;But even with all your effort your arm gives out, slamming back onto the rest. The effort has exhausted you. You don't think you'll be able to try again. All you can do is hope you got it right the first time.;

line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Hold_steady-174;There's no reason to second-guess yourself now. You look at the ever growing star and  	wonder if it will be your grave. If being torn down to atoms and scattered into space could be 	considered a grave.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Hold_steady-175;[[Hold steady 2]];
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Hold_steady_2-176;The pulsar looms closer. You can feel its pull and you're sure that even with every display 	around you blaring warnings that you're exceeding engine power limits, you're not going fast 	enough. The rattling of the ship starts to worsen again, accompanied by groans as the engines 	try to outrun the star's magnetic field.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Hold_steady_2-177;Even though you're certain that the ship will give and dive directly into the star itself you see it 	slowly start pass below you. This may be it! It just might work!;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Hold_steady_2-178;The ship accelerates as the magnetic field and thrust of engines align, shooting you towards the 	star again. Your starship is screaming for mercy, its metal chassis threatening to buckle with the 	shifting of forces. They're at enough equilibrium that you can move again but not for long.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Hold_steady_2-179;What will you do?;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Hold_steady_2-180;Divert power to inertial dampeners.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Hold_steady_2-181;Put everything you've got into the engines.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Divert_power_to_dampeners-182;A ship can only take so much. There's not much point in escaping the star's pull in pieces. You access the power distribution panel and divert a small portion to inertial dampeners. It will slow you down, but the ship seems to groan in relief.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Divert_power_to_dampeners-183;The ship careens impossibly fast back towards the star. Once again you're forced into your seat as you fall, hoping to be tossed away for good this time.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Divert_power_to_dampeners-184;The star passes you once again, faster this time. The ship once again starts to shriek as the magnetic forces tear at its hull. There are a few alarming cracks and some malfunctions you'll have to look over but it seems the ship will hold.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Divert_power_to_dampeners-185;You feel you're almost there. The star seems so much further than when you first arrived. But your ship starts to decelerate. You can still make it. Just need to move forward a little more...;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Divert_power_to_dampeners-186;But it's not enough. Eventually the star's pull grabs you once again and you begin to fall back into its open arms. You know your ship won't survive a pass close enough to get the speed you need.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Divert_power_to_dampeners-187;Is there anything you can do?;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Divert_power_to_dampeners-188;Accept your fate;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Divert_power_to_dampeners-189;Try anyway.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Accept_fate-190;You feel you've done enough and now it's time to accept the inevitable. If the ship is to be destroyed anyway, and you along with it, then you might as well look upon the terrifying beauty of what kills you. It burns placidly in the shrinking distance, entirely unaware of the predicament it is causing you.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Accept_fate-191;Still it's stunningly beautiful. A blue ball of pulsing flame that makes it seem alive its surface covered in plasma storms with bursts of blinding light and radiation. It may kill you but it's almost worth it to witness something so incredible and rare with your own eyes.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Accept_fate-192;As you continue to look on you notice a sort of dark... spot crossing in front of it. It's moving fast so it's hard to tell but there is definitely something obstructing the light from the magnetar in front of you.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Accept_fate-193;Automatic sensors pick it up as well. You're surprised they're still working, although you begin to question that after seeing the readings.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Accept_fate-194;The dark spot is apparently some sort of planet, or so the sensors claim. However it is of unusual structure. While planets tended towards gases or earthy masses with varied insides this seemed to be one great, homogeneous lump of unknown metal. Though that might just be the radiation wreaking havoc on the sensors.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Accept_fate-195;Still it's big and it's solid. What do you want to do?;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Accept_fate-196;Go for it.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Accept_fate-197;Leave it alone;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Try_anyway-198;You're not going to let impossible odds make you give up now. You once again put everything you can into the engines. The ship whines and whimpers but you ignore it. It'll just have to hold and that's all there is to it.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Try_anyway-199;You continue riding the forces of the star. They grip your ship, trying to tear it back into its deadly orbit, but you continue to push even when you can hear the ship tearing itself apart at the seams.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Try_anyway-200;At last it all proves too much and the glass dome bursts into countless shards. They rain down on you, punching many holes through your suit as the metal encasing you peels back like an onion.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Try_anyway-201;As you continue to drift away with the many pieces of your broken ship you realize that ironically you've made it outside the pulsar's grasp. Yet even now your suit runs out of air and you feel light-headed and very cold as your blood seeps out of you in little globules.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Try_anyway-202;In moments you succumb. So quiet. So peaceful.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Go_for_it-203;The only other option is to dive head first into that star. This close to the pulsar the forces rattle the ship enough that you manage to ride one of the jerks to slam your hand on the panel. You feel like your hand might be crushed and your arm broken but you should be able to make minor adjustments to your course.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Go_for_it-204;You find it hard to pin down the planet. Its orbit is erratic, buzzing about like a fly in the wind. You've never seen anything like this before. Still, you manage to keep up with its movements so that it starts to swell as you close in on it.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Go_for_it-205;Your ship groans and shudders with a loud crack that feels like it slaps against your spine. Major engine failure warnings blare loudly all around you so that you can hardly see the planet through their glow. Not that it matters much.That shudder was from the planet grabbing hold of you. Without the engines you can only hope you have enough thrusters to survive the landing.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Go_for_it-206;Oddly enough you find that the closer you get to the planet the smoother your descent becomes. As if the planet itself resisted the roiling gravitic and magnetic forces of the magnetar. Still, you are descending very fast. You hardly have time to activate landing thrusters to slow yourself down before you skid across a surface of shattered, shivering metal. You bounce off of it hard again and again, spinning and careering through endless shards of metal. It makes your head swim and ache until your consciousness gives in and you black out.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Leave_it_alone-207;There's no point. Whether you land on that heap of metal or dive into the star you'll be just as dead. You lean back and close your eyes, letting the ship make its own decision.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Leave_it_alone-208;When you open your eyes again the planet is gone and the pulsar takes up the entirety of your vision. You gaze upon it in wonder. A vast, fiery ocean with ripples of sapphire flame. You watch as these ripples shoot up into great gouts wreathed by pinions of lightning. It all looks so... alive.;
line:.\Magnetar\Magnetars_Rage_1.yarn-Leave_it_alone-209;Your ship finally gives under the colossal stress placed upon it. The dome cracks and then shatters, the metal twisting like putty. Remnants of the protective field give you a brief, peaceful moment in space before the terrible roar of the pulsar overtakes you. The light, the heat, the gravity, the magnetic field all all tearing at you until you are less than dust.;
